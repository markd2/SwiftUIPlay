# Yoginator

An app to run through some yoga poses.

But more of an excuse to play with some App Architecture ideas
from David House's CoocaHeads/Atlanta talk in April of 2021 that
had a bunch of really cool ideas.

Write up of stuff hopefully sometime, but for now, just plumbing a MVP
to see what things feel like

### ToDo

(Get playback running)

- [X] get a view up (essentially the player view)
- [X] plumb a view model
- [X] have a bool to control some ui (running / paused)
- [X] Need to add a higher-level coordinator thingie like the LoTR game, so maybe add that first
- [X] Actually run a timer that can update a label
- [X] have a button to pause / play on the leaf view
- [X] logic to change poses
  - [X] maybe a button to skip - can get move logic without the timer involved
- [X] proper starting
- [ ] definitely can use a refactor and cleanup - couple of big views and
      viewmodels, add type aliases for publish
- [ ] make UI non-ugly

(Do editing)

- [ ] TBD
