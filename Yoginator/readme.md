# Yoginator

An app to run through some yoga poses.

But more of an excuse to play with some App Architecture ideas
from David House's CoocaHeads/Atlanta talk in April of 2021 that
had a bunch of really cool ideas.

Write up of stuff hopefully sometime, but for now, just plumbing a MVP
to see what things feel like

### ToDo

(Get playback running)

- [X] get a view up (essentially the player view)
- [X] plumb a view model
- [X] have a bool to control some ui (running / paused)
- [ ] have a button that can change that, and see the UI toggle
      - [ ] Need to add a higher-level coordinator thingie like the LoTR game.
- [ ] Actually run a timer that updates labels (and also obeys the run state)
- [ ] Plumb a pose image into the view (image loading)


(Do editing)

- [ ] TBD
